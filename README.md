Traffic Management System
The main concept of traffic technology is on planning, designing, and implementing the transportation network, traffic control systems and public service in order to have smooth and efficient transportation and services.

We have proposed a framework for Traffic management system there are still many issues left for further development.

In this project we have provided a summary of Traffic Department functional. When a tourist will come to our Island they don’t know where they go to the destination in short time without getting stuck in traffic and they don’t have much time to travel Whole Island in short term visit. Therefore our concept will help them not only tourist but also citizen of Sri Lankan as well.
